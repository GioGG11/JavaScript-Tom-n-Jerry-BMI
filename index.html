        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>The exercises below are to be done during and following your viewing of the resources.  Please push your completed project to a repository on Github.  Provide the link to your repo. Each activity should be appropriately labeled in its own folder.
            </p>

            <p>VERY EASY: Write a function named min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum
                ...go to the console for this one, I don't want to make a button for this one. Just put two numbers in the following format and you got it. .findMin("firstNumber", "secondNumber").

            </p>
            <br><BR>
            <p>EASY: Create an array of students holding their last name, first name, and age with 3 students. To validate, please log a greeting with the first name, last name and age of the 2nd student. The output should look like "Hello, my name is John Doe and I'm 19 years old."
            </p>
            <center><button onclick = "studentLogIn()">Log In</button></center>
            <BR><BR>
            <p>MEDIUM: Create a program that accepts a number (1-12) as input and logs to the console that number and its corresponding month. For example: if the user enters the number 3, then it should return the month “March.” Alert the user if they enter an invalid number (e.g. less than 1 or greater than 12).
            </p>
            <center>\<button onclick = "monthDate()">Try me!</button></center>
            <p>HARD: Given the information below for Tom and Jerry. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tom - height: 9in - mass 8g</li>
                <li>Jerry - height: 10in - mass: 45g</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Compare the BMI (Body Mass Index) of Tom & Jerry using the formula below:
            </p>
            <center><p>BMI = mass/height^2 = mass(height*height)</p></center>
            <p>Store Tom & Jerry’s mass and height as variables. Calculate both their BMI’s. Create a Boolean variable containing information about whether Tom has a higher BMI than Jerry. Print a string to the console with the variable from step 3 ( e.g. Is Tom’s BMI higher than Jerry’s? false).
            </p>
            <center><button onclick = "findBMI()">Find-Out the BMI!</button></center>
